Wool 0.1

Wool requires GCC, make and a shell. 

The script 'wool.sh' takes an integer argument <n> and produces a
header file (to stdout) which defines task definition macros for arity
1 to <n> and loop body macros for arity 0 to <n-2>. Name the header file
'wool.h'. 

The file 'wool.c' implements the slow part of the run time system and it
also defines 'main()'. Compiler it to a .o file and link.

Compile and link the main program with pthreads (-pthread under Linux 
and -lpthread under Solaris). Typical command line:

  gcc -pthread -O3 -o foo foo.c wool.o

The other C files included are example programs.

Have fun!
