the node list is written regulary to disk by specialy "write node list to disk" work units that is put on the queues by a worker thread.

then a node starts the node list is read from disk and pruned (each ip checked, sending "heartbeat protocol messages" to each node), the new list is then written to disk.

each new ip discovered is put on the list in memory and the new list writen to disk. a "scan all meta data chunks and put new unknown ips to the list in ram and write it to disk" workunit handles the updating of the list.
